            <p class="sub3">Sushi</p>
            <p class="content">Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish consisting of vinegared rice combined with various
                ingredients such as seafood (like raw fish or cooked shrimp), vegetables, and sometimes tropical fruits.
                It's often served with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger.
                Sushi comes in various forms, including nigiri (a small mound of rice with a slice of fish or seafood on
                top), maki (rolled sushi with rice and fillings wrapped in seaweed), and sashimi (slices of raw fish or
                seafood served without rice).
                Sushi is known for its delicate flavors, beautiful presentation, and emphasis on fresh, high-quality
                ingredients.</p>
